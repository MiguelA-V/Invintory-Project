# Invintory-Project
## This was a side project that a friend needed help on. So we tackled it together
###So I am here documenting the project. Basicly we had an inventory project with product names and counts in a list. my goal was to pull apart the list and house them in separate lists called Product = [] and count = []. By using the isinstance and a for loop and elif functions we were able to do that.
